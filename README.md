# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis
I have worked on sentiment analysis project for my Design project 

I worked on Building a classifier to analyse the sentiment of the movie reviews On IMBD website 

# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
 
## 1.Data Collection: 
Complete information is gathered from the Andrew Maas, Stanford
University. The dataset is for twofold assessment grouping containing significantly a
greater number of information than the other benchmark datasets. He gives a lot of 25K
profoundly polar movie surveys to train the model and 25K audit information to test the
model. There is extra unlabeled information for use too which can be used for other
binary classifications. Crude content and a previously processed and handled bag of
words groups are also collected.

## 2. Data Preprocessing:
Data processing is among the most crucial steps in the complete
machine learning project. The data is cleaned and processed to make it fit for learning
and training the model. The cleaning process is very crucial as the data which is not clean
can never give a good result even when tested on a perfect machine learning model. But
well clean and wrangled data even when trained and tested on an average model will give
a decent result. So we cleaned the data using BeautifulSoup library and by using the bag
of words approach and count vectorizer we made the data clean and ready to be trained.

## 3. Feature Selection: 
Bag of word (BoW) is an approach for most of the NLP and ML
techniques.Apart from BOW we have used Word2Vec( both CBOW and Skip n-gram)
along with this we have tried Doc2Vec in which we implemented PV-DM and
PV-DBOW

## 4. Model Building: 
For this project we trained ml models using Linear Support Vector
Machine Classifier, Random Forest Classifier. These machine
learning algorithms are some of the most powerful approaches to work with Natural
Language Processing problems.
